üìÑ The Home page is a contemporary, exciting landing page providing images of temples and temple attending activities and must include the following:
A call to action to make a hotel reservation
Readily available navigation and contact information for the hotel chain
Summary information about a temple of your choosing
Social media links (at least two)
Current weather card that summarizes the conditions. You must use the One Call API at openweathermap.org (Links to an external site.) and include the following content.
The current temperature, current condition description, and humidity.
Weather alerts if available/applicable from the government and display it as a closeable message at the top of the page. Closeable means the user can click to remove the alert.
Display and label a three day forecast of the "day" temperature using the current date. This can be designed in another card or area.


üìÑ The Temple page describes the details for at least four temples of your choice providing information about the address, telephone, email, services, history, ordinance schedule, session schedule, temple closure schedule. This information must be stored in a separate JSON file in order to be considered for full credit. You can store this .json file in another üìÅfolder in your site folder. Display the temple information like a layout of 'cards'. You may elect to have additional information shown upon clicking a card. Provide a 'LIKE' button/interface that the user  can click to 'like' a particular temple and that information is stored in localStorage. The next time a particular user visits, that 'like' indicator should be apparent.
Temple Information can be found on Temples list (Links to an external site.) on lds.org.


üìÑ The Reservation page contains a form that collects relevant information when making a normal stay reservation including the location, date, number and type of rooms, registrant's full name, email, phone, home state or country, and special accommodations/comments. Make sure to do some form validation.


üìÑ The Services page provides a list with information of the amenities and special services offered at the hotel along with the following sub pages/content:
The reception page displaying information about the wedding reception accommodations, including options for food service and setup.
A full-time temple missionary page that provides information and images about the suites offered at the hotel with a simple Contact Us form for more details. 
Each page should have a footer that contains contact information including a link to a Google map (Links to an external site.) showing the company headquarter address at 4800 Montgomery Ln #300, Bethesda, MD 20814 . Additional items might include social media links (again), a basic Contact Us form, and/or other relevant material.
