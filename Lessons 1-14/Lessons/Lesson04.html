        <h3>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h3>
        <p>What I learned from this chapter is that errors will always happen in programming. They could be errors from the system, from the users, or from programmers. Errors can manifest in three different ways. They can throw an exception, which returns a value, that you can use to handle the error.</p>

        <h3>How Single-Page Applications Work</h3>
        <p>Single-page application" (SPA) is the general term for a web application that loads a single HTML page and then updates the page dynamically, instead of loading new pages. After the initial page load, the SPA talks with the server through AJAX requests.</p>

        <h3>The Problem with Single Page Apps</h3>
        <p>“Problem” is such a negative word. Let’s say that Single Page Applications (SPAs) and mobile webapps present new security “challenges”. We call these types of applications “untrusted clients” since our server-side code has no control over the environment they run in.</p>

        <h3>HTML5 Template Element</h3>
        <p>the writer of the article summarized what the Template element is so I will just quote from the article this part, “Put simply, it provides an easy way to define a reusable fragment of HTML that can be manipulated just like you would the contents of the document itself…” It is also important to say the Template element though it is in the HTML document, it doesn’t get rendered. It only renders when it has been cloned.</p>
