        <h3>Master Mobile UX</h3>
        <p>From what I learned from these videos was the Mobile-First design should be the beginning of when you are building web-apps. It’s easier to create from mobile first and then apply to a desktop there always more on a desktop where mobile is just shortcuts therefore, you and less and create faster. An example I’d like to give is Disney plus if you watch movies or tv shows on a streaming app on mobile you only get access to watch what you want when ever you want, but on desktop; you can watch all you want but also have an access on your account more features you can change price plans, also, instead of looking one by on which title of movie you want to watch, you get to see wide variety of what you want to watch.</p>

        <h3>Chapter 12: Object Oriented Programming</h3>
        <p>It’s great to come across things that are familiar to you from this chapter I came across the three concepts of OOP which are encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, last semester my team mates and I created a game of a snake collecting body parts to make the snake grow, and these three concepts were taught to us encapsulation means to grab something and keep it hidden like a time capsule for example, polymorphism means multiple things more than one so the time capsule example again I can add one thing inside the time capsule or multiple things, and the last thing inheritance which means to receive something from someone has been holding for you time capsule example I can say that the time capsule wasn’t meant for me to only see but could be my future son if im not around, and he inherited everything I left in the time capsule.</p>

        <h3>Object Methods, “This”</h3>
        <p>The man in the video explained creating a class and we create an instance of that class creating and object, the parameters that we set in that instance are the ones that this is going to reference because “this” references the object that calls the function.</p>

        <h3>Ch15 Modern JavaScript, Modular JavaScript</h3>
        <p>This section explains how you can use modules in JS. Modules are files with code that has the same objective. We learned about classes that encapsulates code with specific tasks, but this time all the code goes into one file which are called modules. The way to share functions or code from one module to another file is by exporting the files that will be used, and then in the other file importing only the pieces of the module that we need.</p>
