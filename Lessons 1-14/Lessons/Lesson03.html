        <h3>Chapter 9: The Window Object</h3>
        <p>From what I understood about the window object, the window object represents an open window in a Brower. The window object is the topmost object of DOM hierarchy. The properties and methods of window that are commonly known are closed, console, controllers, frames[], and so much more one definition I can give of one of those properties is frames which it represents an array that contains all the frames of a given window</p>

        <h3>MDN The Content Template Element</h3>
        <p>What I understood about the template element is that you can create this element in an html file with the purpose of cloning it to create more elements based on it. When created, it is not going to be rendered to the page, because it is meant to be a template as its name suggests.</p>
