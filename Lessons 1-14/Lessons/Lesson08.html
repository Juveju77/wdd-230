        <h3>Getting Started with JSON Web Tokens</h3>
        
        <p>What I understand from the article and other resources, JWTs purpose is to verify a user and then if everything is alright the server will authorize the user access to different information or pages in the server. All the information required for this process is in the same JWT, coded using one from many different algorithms. A JWT has three parts, the header which contains the type of token and algorithm, the payload that contains the information about the user, and the signature which is a key generated by the server to identify the user and make sure that no changes were made in the JWT.</p>

        <h3>Develop, Debug, Learn?</h3>

        <p>Chris Heilmann, talks about problems that may arouse while the web development world started growing. Like how libraries and different tools were created, resulting in projects build around those tools that made developers dependent on the libraries to solve some problems for them. Tools that were created and soon enough disappeared.</p>

        <P>He also talks about how entering the world of development has become a little hostile, so the old learning flow isn’t too much of a good thing to use anymore. So, one of his suggestions is making easier for people to learn while they are developing. Having tools that can highlight relevant information in your code, or showing in real time changes made in your projects so you don’t have to switch from the editor to your browser and then to documentation on the web to find solutions to your problems. The idea is to have all of that in just one environment, so you don’t have to constantly switch between your tools.</P>
