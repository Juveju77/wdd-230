        <h3>Chapter 8 Forms</h3>
        <p>What I learned from reading about Forms, is that forms are made up of a <form> element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons. These input fields can be populated with information that is processed once the form has been submitted.</p>

            <p>Traditionally, when a form was submitted, it would be sent to a server where the information would be processed using a 'back end' language such as PHP or Ruby. It’s possible, and becoming more and more common, to process the information in a form on the 'front end' before it is sent to the server using JavaScript, which is what we’ll be focusing on in this chapter.
            </p>

        <h3>Using Form Data Objects Effectively</h3>
        <p>In this video the author explains how you can get all elements in a Form element, without having to create variables for each one of them. To do it he uses the FormData object, which gets everything inside a form and then you can send that information to the server. Also, shows how you can turn your Form object into JSON, so that you can send JSON to the server instead. The most important things to remember from this video are, first, that all your inputs should have a name for the FormData object to work; second, you should prevent the submit button to send information by default using the “preventDefault()” method.</p>
            <p>Example of code:
            label for="username">Username:
            input type="text" id="username" name="username" required
            -The username is required to send the information from the Form. Nothing will happen until that input is filled correctly.
            -It is possible to make validation filters using JavaScript as well
            </p>

        <h3>MDN: Client-site Form validation</h3>
        <p>From this article I learned that you can validate form information with the built-in validation attributes on HTML5, or using JS. JS is a better option if you need more specific form validation, and when browsers don’t support HTML5 form validation. There are two ways that you can implement form validation using JS, one is using the constraint validation API, and the other is using just plain JS, which is of course a little more complicated. I must remember to study patterns in HTML5, because there were few examples in this article, and the constraint validation API because they showed only one example.
            You can also constrain the character length of all text fields created by <input> or <textarea> by using the minlength and maxlength attributes. A field is invalid if it has a value and that value has fewer characters than the minlength value or more than the maxlength value.
            If the elements from the Form element don’t have the attribute “name” the data object will be empty, it does need to have a name object.
