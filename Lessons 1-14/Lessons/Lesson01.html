        <h3>Syllabus</h3>
        <p>From what I understood this course is to help give you the skills on how to use CSS, HTML and JS, to build web applications without the help of frameworks or libraries. In this course we are going to use Site Point which is meant for reading books, also, using Git, GitHub, and VS Code.In this course for weeks 5-7 I will further apply what I have learned by designing and completing a project of mine choosing. But for the first 4.5 weeks of the course, we will work in teams on a project modeled off of real-world projects.Our final grade will be based on our own raking against the course outcomes at the end of the semester, and a portfolio that we should start creating along the semester.What is expected of us each week reading assignments: ~2hrs,Team & individual activities: ~4-6hrs,Trello cards: ~3hrs,Professor led instruction: ~1hr (recorded weekly office hour)</p>

        <h3>Working with groups</h3>
        <p>From what understood it was talking about that if people don’t talk to each other, it becomes the main issue, without communication other problems will come such as not finding a time to work together, and not turning the work on time. We should prioritize the time to meet with our teams, but we should look a way to work as one team, never judge and help one another through each other’s struggles and we can use tools like Slack (Or MS Teams), GitHub and Trello to start the communication and be where we need to be.</p>

        <h3>Course Set Up</h3>
        <p>I have set up all that I needed. But there is one thing I’m having difficulty installing but it is in vs code I tried installing start, lint, and format, but it keeps giving me an error message I’m not entirely sure why so I’m going to ask my teammates and hopefully things get resolved.</p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
